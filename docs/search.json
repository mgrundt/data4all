    "text": "I am into computers since i was gifted my first 486 DX 40Mhz in 1993. Most of the time i played video games like Monkey Island, Dune 2 RTS, Sam & Max etc. Besides that i was always curious about the coding side, wanted to glimpse behind the curtain. But i never did the serious step, like getting a degree in computer science or begin with coding on my own. Maybe i was looking for an easy way.\nAs life went on, i studied economics with strong interest in the “number crushing” side of it. But somewhere in my mind there were always this little itch to code to make the computer do what i want.\nThe years passed and i got jobs, built a family. Besides i bought tons of books about coding which i never read, tried myriads of tutorials and forgot all the content and bought to many Udemy Courses which i never started.\nI somehow never get to point, where it flows.\nIt was and is frustrating…but i never lost the motivation to get it. I think i am stuck in tutorial hell right now or maybe since a couple of years.\nThis is my newest try to escape tutorial hell and finally get something to work. Wish me luck!"

    "section": "The How",
    "text": "The How\nInspired by the “100 Days of Code” - Challenges, i will try to make it through Hadley Wickhams’s “R for Data Science, 2nd” and afterwards “Mastering Shiny” by the same author. I’ve made a rough plan to fit the content in the 100 Days of Code -Schema.\n\nWhy R?\nGood Question. It’s simply feels right for me. This might sound a little weird, but i tried Python, Javascript, Java, C# etc. And somehow the R world (as far as i have discovered it) feels right. Maybe it’s the economics background, i dont know.\nI like Python too, but a lot of things in R feel easier at least for me. Beginning with the IDE (RStudio) and the bulk of free availabe learning recources like “R for Data Science”, Posit’s Tutorials just to name a tiny tip of the iceberg.\n\n\nWhy the Books?\nLike i mentioned earlier, i am kind of into the “number crushing” faction and web dev, so the field of “Data Science” in combination with Shiny seems like a good compromise between the two areas of coding and numbers.\nFirst and foremost, i like the topics in the books and the authors style, so i have at least the feeling not missing important topics. I’de like to learn proper groundings of the field (hence “R for Data Science”) and afterwards try to put them into Web Apps (Hi, “Mastering Shiny”!).\nThe resources are freely availabe on the web, which is a huge plus! Thank you Mr WIckham and Posit for the great content.\nAnyway, i made a plan for the 100 Days of Code in R, which is related to the above mentioned resources. You can see it in the table below. I will try to follow it and stick to the two main rules of the 100 Days Challenge. I there are changes in the plan and there will be changes, i will adjust it accordingly.\n\nAt least 1 hour of coding every day\nTweeting my progress with #100DaysOfCode\n\nAdditionally there will be blog posts on this site with details on my journey.\n\n\nThe Plan (Day 1 - 10)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDay\nTopic (Course Name)\nTo Do\n\n\n\n\n1\nR for Data Science\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n2\n\n\nData visualization\n\n\n\n3\n\n\nWorkflow: basics\n\n\n\n4\n\n\nData Transformation\n\n\n\n5\n\n\nWorkflow: code style\n\n\n\n6\n\n\nData tidying\n\n\n\n7\n\n\nWorkflow: scripts and projects\n\n\n\n8\n\n\nData Import\n\n\n\n9\n\n\nWorkflow: getting help\n\n\n\n10\n\n\nLayers\n\n\n\n11\n\n\nExploratory data analysis\n\n\n\n12\n\n\nCommunication"

Thanks.\nEven before the start, by writing this blog post, my brain keeps telling me:\n“Ah, let’s try this and that too!”,\n“Why not Python and R in parallel?”,\n“You set up a blog, cool, let’s write about other topics too!”\nWell…No!\n(It will be hard to resist the temptations and focus on the challenge…)"
